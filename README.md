# MazePentti

A simple command line maze app for Buutti.
Special feature of this app is that neither the traverse algorithm or the traveller in the maze do not know the absolute position of itself in the maze or the real sizes of the maze, which is actually a natural situation, but seem to be ignored in many maze solving algorithms. This app Utilizes Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.

Run the app with command:
java -jar MazePentti.jar
